# Waterstons

**Strategic Digital & IT Partner | Est. 1994**

Waterstons is a business and technology consultancy with nearly three decades of experience helping organisations unlock the full potential of technology. With a team of almost 300 specialists across the UK and Australia, we work with clients ranging from household names to critical national infrastructure — delivering honest, independent advice and tailored solutions that drive real business outcomes.

We are not a typical IT company. Our consultancy-led approach means we listen first, understand the business challenge, and then apply the right technology to solve it. From strategy through to delivery and ongoing support, we are with our clients every step of the way.

## Our Values

Everything we do is underpinned by a commitment to honesty, independence, and genuine care for our clients and people.

## Technology & Open Source

Our engineering teams work across a broad technology landscape including Microsoft Azure, .NET, Docker, DevOps pipelines, and cybersecurity tooling.
